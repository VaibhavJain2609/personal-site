# Intro

I am Vaibhav Jain, a recent graduate from Sacramento State University, with a Bachelors in Computer Science, passionate about software engineering. My journey in this field has equipped me with extensive experience in developing and implementing projects using Java, Python, Java Spring Boot, and Angular. I've had the opportunity to lead and collaborate with cross-functional teams, notably at Sacramento State University, where I successfully modernized a legacy system by addressing requirement gaps and updating the tech stack. My involvement in hackathons and internships has further honed my skills and fueled my passion for innovation. With a solid foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical application, I am eager to contribute to and grow in technical roles.
